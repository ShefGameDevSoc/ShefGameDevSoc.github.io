  Hi, and welcome to GameDevSoc!

  We're a society that hopes to provide a space for students, new & old, to collaborate and work together to build on their skills and create amazing games!

  We have big plans for the upcoming year ranging from:

  - Game Jams
  - Competitions 
  - Tutorials
  - Talks
  - Socials

  The society is open to anyone from a whole host of different disciplines as games always require people with unique skillsets to excel. We hope to accommodate everyone's diverse interests and abilities by covering many different topics that may be regularly overlooked in the game dev industry.
