introduction: |
  Sheffield game development society (ShaD) was formed in 2011 with the goals to be a cross-generational, diverse group, and promote Sheffield's games community. Since its formation, they have successfully organised a games industry showcase, a games festival, and an annual gaming night as well as a number of events which are listed below. ShaD's activities are centred on providing the best experience for Sheffield's games development and design community.  The primary function of the Sheffield Game Development Society is to enable Sheffield's game development community to access the resources it requires to carry out, develop, produce and present high quality work, and to provide opportunities for the local game development community to network, share ideas and work collaboratively to develop the Sheffield games industry.
