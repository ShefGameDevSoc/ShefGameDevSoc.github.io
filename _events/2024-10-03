# What's the session about?

Next week Thursday (03/10/24) we're going to have a GIAG in Computer Room 4 of the Diamond from 5pm - 7pm. We'll be covering the basics of Godot, from the in and outs of the engine to how to code the starts of your own scripts. No worries if you're new â€“ we'll guide you through crafting your own simple game from the ground up! 

If any of this sounds interesting to you make sure to grab a free ticket from the link below :)
