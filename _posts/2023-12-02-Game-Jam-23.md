## Thanks to everyone who came to Steel Jam, we had a blast!
We hope you enjoyed the free food and snacks, the movie night and of course werewolf. The theme for this jam was ```switching perspectives`` and we loved what people came up with.
## We were very pleased with the number of quality submissions, here are just a few of our favorites

### Science guy and Alien Girl
We loved this take on the flash game classic, making great creative use of the theme ```Switching Persectives```. 
You play as both of the characters each with a slightly different movement machanic, you can then switch perspectives to get around obsticles and complete the level

### Labrynth
Labrynth was a cool arcade style puzzle game where you can only see one dimension at a time. By ```switching perspectives``` you can effectivley move around the level. What amazed us about this game was the fact it could run on a tiny Arduino computer, meaning it was coded from scratch in C++ and could fit in a few kilobytes!

### Heaven or Hell
Heaven or hell was a platformer in which you could interpret the world in two different ways. One way allowed you to see the good side and gain health pickpus, the other way allowed you to see the enemies which could kill you no matter which ```perspective``` you were in. We loved the idea and would have liked to see what creative levels could be created given more time!

### Swarm
Swarm was a twist on the classic spaceship vs alien game type we all enjoy. Only this time you have ```switched perspective``` to be in control of the swarm of enemies, intent on taking down what would typically be the player. We loved the art style and gameplay mechanic.

### Crack Attack
You play as multiple people in control of an armoured truck, escaping with the last crack in all of Los Angles. You can ```switch perspectives``` between the driving and gun view, and must cross the golden gate bridge while sending off attacks from enemies.
